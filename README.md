# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for POST requests. The provided code snippet shows an example of an Express.js application that handles a POST request to create a user. However, it does not include any error handling for invalid or missing data in the request body.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The solution shows how to implement robust error handling to prevent these issues and provide better feedback to the user or other systems interacting with your API.
